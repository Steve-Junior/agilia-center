**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate --seed

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with categories. This can help you to quickly start testing a couple of frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the CategoriesSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/CategoriesSeeder.php

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh
